# Weather Dashboard

## Description

For users that wish to search a five day forecast within any city in the United Status, the weather dashboard easily pulls in the current day's temperature, wind speed, humidity, and displays the weather in an icon for the day. The search will also pull in the same data over the next five days. 

This project helped me gain a solid understanding of using server side APIs and pulling in the right data fields, and mapping them to the right location within the html. The project also uses dayjs to find today's date and display the date over the next five days with the weather.

## Usage

Users can search any city in the United States to see a current five-day forecast. 

When users search for an additional city, the search is saved on screen and can be revisited to view again without typing in the search bar. The user's searches are also saved to local storage.
